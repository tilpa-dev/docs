Start using the Tilpa Adaptive API SDK for Python by installing `tilpa-api-sdk` through pip:

```sh
pip install tilpa-api-sdk
```
Then, initalize an Adaptive API like so:

```python
from tilpa_api_sdk import Adaptive_API

# Example of how to initialize the Adaptive_API class
adaptive_api = Adaptive_API(
  adaptive_api_key="your_adaptive_api_key",
  open_ai_key="your_openai_api_key",
  path_to_service_account_key="path_to_firebase_service_account_key",
  port="port_for_the_api",
)
adaptive_api.start()
```
Note that all parameters are optional except adaptive_api_key.

Once you have an Adaptive_API initialized, dynamically add endpoints to your API like so:
```python
endpoint_name, endpoint_methods = adaptive_api.add_feature(user_prompt)
```
Where `user_prompt` is a string that describes the feature you want to add.

That's it! You now have an API to which you can dynamiclly add features.
